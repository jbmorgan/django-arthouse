django-arthouse
===============
The goal of django-arthouse is to streamline the process of booking, scheduling, and promoting films and special events for arthouse cinemas. Note: this (read: any, all) feature has not yet been implemented.

Features
--------
None yet.

Requirements
------------
 * django 1.4
 * python 2.6
 * django-bootstrap-toolkit
 * pil

Installation
------------
 1. Copy `arthouse/secrets.py.example` to `arthouse/secrets.py`
 2. django-arthouse requires an API key from The Movie Database (available under "API Details" at the [TMDB account page](https://www.themoviedb.org/account)). Copy your API key and save it in `arthouse/secrets.py`
 3. There's probably other stuff. To be continued.

Notes
-----
As mentioned above, django-arthouse is a brand new project and, as such, doesn't do a whole lot as of yet. This repository contains an entire django site at the moment, but it will most likely be repackaged as a standalone django app at some point in the future. While I have worked as a django developer for some time, this is my first attempt at an open source django app for public consumption.
