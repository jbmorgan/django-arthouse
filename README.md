django-arthouse
===============
The goal of django-arthouse is to streamline the process of booking, scheduling, and promoting films and special events for arthouse cinemas. Note: this (read: any, all) feature has not yet been implemented.

Features
--------
None yet.

Requirements
------------
 * django 1.4
 * python 2.6
 * django-bootstrap-toolkit

Installation
------------

Notes
-----
As mentioned above, django-arthouse is a brand new project and, as such, doesn't do a whole lot as of yet. This repository contains an entire django site at the moment, but it will most likely be repackaged as a standalone django app at some point in the future. While I have worked as a django developer for some time, this is my first attempt at an open source django app for public consumption.
